# react-style-perf

This is a quick little demo to test the performance implications of where inline styles are placed

To run this test:

    git clone git@github.com:esonderegger/react-style-perf.git
    cd react-style-perf
    npm install
    npm start

Open the page at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

Then comment/uncomment pairs of lines in `src/index.jsx` and observe changes in the task manager / performance panel.
